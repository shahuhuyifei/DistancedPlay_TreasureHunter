# Distanced Play - Treasure Hunter

## Game Rules
Treasure Hunter is a two-player card game. One player is the Hider, and another player is the Hunter. The Hunter’s goal is to guess where the Hider hides the treasure, and the Hider’s goal is to stop the Hunter from getting the treasure. The game ends when the Hunter correctly guesses the scene card that hides the treasure (Hunter win) or after three rounds (Hider win), whichever occurs first. 

Each player receives six corresponding scene cards. The Hider chooses a scene card to hide the treasure. There are three rounds in total. In each round, the players play a gesture game. If the Hunter wins the gesture game, the Hider must give a hint (the hint asks the Hider to describe the scene card that hides the treasure) to the Hunter, and then the Hunter can guess the scene card that hides the treasure. In the gesture game, the colour of the LED strip represents which gesture the players need to perform. There are four gestures in total, swipe up (red), swipe down (blue), swipe left (yellow), and swipe right (green). Players need to match the randomly generated colour with the corresponding gestures, and the game ends when each player has performed the ten gestures. The player who performs the ten gestures faster wins. A card that tells the gestures and the corresponding colours is provided to players, and players can choose to look at it when playing or memorise it for a more challenging game.
